                    <h2>Best-selling movie genres</h2>
                <p>Results of our studies show, that the best-selling genre is <b>Drama</b>. It doesn’t surprise us: it’s a universal genre, 
                    everybody can find something interesting in it. It also can combine with other genres, like Science Fiction or Fantasy. 
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Second best-selling genre is <b>Action</b> which also makes sense since a lot of people prefer to watch action movies on a big screen rather than in home just 
                by themselves. This genre, just like Drama, can combine with others. 
                <br>
                <br>
                Third place in this chart belongs to <b>Adventure</b> movies. Its 
            popularity can be result of wide range of viewers that can like this genre. After all, "Adventure" is a label that can be given movies for both, adullts and kids.</p>

                    <h2>Director with the greatest amount of best-selling movies</h2>
                <p>Our studies showed that the director with most profitable movies is 
                <b>Herman Yau Lai-to</b> born in Hong Kong. We suspected to see at the top an American director, 
                so Herman Yau surprised us a lot.
                <br>
                <br>
                While the first place was unexpected, the second one didn't shock anyone -
                <b>Steven Spilberg</b>, director of hits like "Javs", "Jurassic Park" or "Indiana Jones" just had to be at the top of this chart.
                <br>
                <br>
                However, there are more not well known directors in top20, many of them turned out to gain better scores than a 
                lot of famous directors, like J. J. Abrams, James Cameron or Christopher Nolan.</p>

                    <h2>Year with the greatest amount of best-selling movies</h2>
                    <p>It turned out that the most profitable year according to Box Office was <b>2015</b>, which doesn’t suprise us at all. According to our 
                        research, 2015 is a realese year of very popular and highly awaited movies, for example the second part of <i>Avengers</i> - 
                    <b>Avengers: Age of Ultron</b>, the last part of <b>The Hunger Games</b> trilogy and finally, new <i>Star Wars</i> movie - <b>Star Wars: Episode VII - 
                            The Force Awakens</b>.</p>

                    <h2>The most profitable month to release a movie</h2>
                    <p>Without any doubts, <b>June</b> is the best month to release a movie. It got 145 billion dollars, having only 4543 movies. 
                        It can be because it's a holiday month, so it's a good time for young people to visit theatre. The second and the third favorite 
                        cinemas’ months are <b>January</b> (118 billion dollars) and <b>May</b> (117 billion dollars). 
                        However, only 4628 movies were released in May, when in January there were 8342 of them. That makes May a month with less, but more
                        profitale movies.</p>
